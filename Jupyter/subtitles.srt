1
00:00:29,300 --> 00:00:29,900

00:00:30,600 --> 00:00:32,900

You can do this.

7
00:01:27,800 --> 00:01:29,900
Kid, what is wrong with you? You look like

8
00:01:29,900 --> 00:01:31,800
you're 11 years old. I was lead to

9
00:01:31,800 --> 00:01:32,500
puberty.

10
00:01:33,500 --> 00:01:34,100
Okay.

11
00:02:05,900 --> 00:02:07,900
Excuse me. I was thinking about

12
00:02:07,900 --> 00:02:09,800
going for a swim or the pool facilities here.

13
00:02:09,800 --> 00:02:10,200
Nice.

14
00:02:10,900 --> 00:02:12,800
Of course sir. It's the children Hotel

15
00:02:13,000 --> 00:02:15,900
best in the city. What

16
00:02:15,900 --> 00:02:17,800
is the pool clothes and killed the

17
00:02:17,800 --> 00:02:19,300
time? Yes,

18
00:02:21,700 --> 00:02:22,700
ten o'clock.

19
00:02:24,000 --> 00:02:24,300
Thanks.

20
00:02:29,300 --> 00:02:31,000
So are you going you think that's him?

21
00:02:37,000 --> 00:02:39,700
That's the description I didn't go in the room and

22
00:02:39,700 --> 00:02:41,000
exactly is just walking by

23
00:02:45,800 --> 00:02:46,700
stay on the radio.

24
00:03:09,700 --> 00:03:10,700
Rick Sorkin

25
00:03:11,800 --> 00:03:13,100
Rick Sorkin

26
00:03:16,800 --> 00:03:17,700
Rick Sorkin,

27
00:03:18,800 --> 00:03:20,600
excuse me. Mr. Sorkin you are

28
00:03:20,600 --> 00:03:22,900
five minutes late. Is there a reason why I should let

29
00:03:22,900 --> 00:03:23,300
you in.

30
00:03:26,300 --> 00:03:28,900
I'm just trying to ditch the cops. Okay. I don't really care if you

31
00:03:28,900 --> 00:03:29,600
let me in or not.

32
00:03:38,800 --> 00:03:40,200
Mr. Specter will be right with you.

33
00:03:41,600 --> 00:03:43,900
What can I get you anything a coffee

34
00:03:43,900 --> 00:03:45,100
or bottled water?

35
00:03:49,700 --> 00:03:51,800
Hi Rick Sorkin. I respect her

36
00:03:51,800 --> 00:03:53,700
nice to meet you. She have a seat here.

37
00:03:55,100 --> 00:03:57,000
Whoa, what's this?

38
00:04:04,700 --> 00:04:05,500
Can I help you?

39
00:04:07,300 --> 00:04:07,600
No.

40
00:04:15,200 --> 00:04:17,900
Excuse me. Mr. Tate. My name

41
00:04:17,900 --> 00:04:19,700
is Louis Litt. I work for Pearson Hardman.

42
00:04:20,200 --> 00:04:22,500
I have some information that I think will lead you to the

43
00:04:22,500 --> 00:04:24,900
conclusion that you're better served in Pearson with me

44
00:04:24,900 --> 00:04:25,900
as your lead counsel.

45
00:04:27,700 --> 00:04:28,300
I'm listening.

46
00:04:31,700 --> 00:04:33,300
How the hell did you know they were to the

47
00:04:33,300 --> 00:04:35,500
police? I read this novel in

48
00:04:35,500 --> 00:04:36,600
elementary school.

49
00:04:37,700 --> 00:04:39,900
Cops are staking out a hotel one of them dresses as

50
00:04:39,900 --> 00:04:41,500
a bellhop the others a man in a

51
00:04:41,500 --> 00:04:43,900
suit and it was the exact same thing. You

52
00:04:43,900 --> 00:04:45,900
read a novel, you know Elementary

53
00:04:45,900 --> 00:04:47,700
School what I like to

54
00:04:47,700 --> 00:04:48,200
read.

55
00:04:49,600 --> 00:04:51,800
And why'd you ask them what time it was throw them

56
00:04:51,800 --> 00:04:53,900
off? And what kind of drug dealer

57
00:04:53,900 --> 00:04:55,600
asks a cop with time it is when he's got a

58
00:04:55,600 --> 00:04:57,800
briefcase full of pot right? We

59
00:04:57,800 --> 00:04:58,700
should hire you

60
00:04:59,600 --> 00:05:01,600
Jesus. I'd give you the 25 Grand is a

61
00:05:01,600 --> 00:05:03,900
signing bonus. I'll take it.

62
00:05:05,000 --> 00:05:07,900
Unfortunately, we only hire from Harvard and you

63
00:05:07,900 --> 00:05:09,700
not only did not go to Harvard Law

64
00:05:09,700 --> 00:05:10,200
School.

65
00:05:11,500 --> 00:05:13,100
You haven't even gone to any law school.

66
00:05:13,900 --> 00:05:15,800
What if I told you that I consume knowledge like no

67
00:05:15,800 --> 00:05:17,700
one you've ever met and I've actually passed the

68
00:05:17,700 --> 00:05:19,800
bar. I'd say you're full of

69
00:05:19,800 --> 00:05:20,400
crap.

70
00:05:21,900 --> 00:05:23,600
That's a Barbie legal handbook right there,

71
00:05:23,600 --> 00:05:24,100
right?

72
00:05:25,100 --> 00:05:27,400
Open it up read me something anything.

73
00:05:33,000 --> 00:05:35,900
Civil liability associated with agency is based

74
00:05:35,900 --> 00:05:37,700
on several factors, including the

75
00:05:37,700 --> 00:05:39,900
deviation of the agent from his path the

76
00:05:39,900 --> 00:05:41,900
reasonable inference of agency on behalf of the

77
00:05:41,900 --> 00:05:43,700
plaintiff and the nature of the

78
00:05:43,700 --> 00:05:45,100
damages themselves.

79
00:05:46,300 --> 00:05:48,700
How did you know that I learned it

80
00:05:49,100 --> 00:05:51,200
when I studied for the bar?

81
00:05:53,300 --> 00:05:54,200
Okay, how it shut?

82
00:05:55,800 --> 00:05:57,000
first this laptop

83
00:05:58,700 --> 00:05:59,700
I'm going to show you.

84
00:06:00,800 --> 00:06:02,500
What a Harvard attorney can do

85
00:06:03,200 --> 00:06:04,100
pick a topic.

86
00:06:06,000 --> 00:06:08,900
Stock option backdating. Although backdating options is

87
00:06:08,900 --> 00:06:10,800
legal violations. Arise

88
00:06:10,800 --> 00:06:12,900
related to disclosures under

89
00:06:12,900 --> 00:06:14,900
IRC section. 409a

90
00:06:16,100 --> 00:06:18,500
you forgot about sarbanes-oxley statute of

91
00:06:18,500 --> 00:06:20,900
limitations render. Sarbanes-oxley moot post

92
00:06:20,900 --> 00:06:22,700
2007. Well not if you can

93
00:06:22,700 --> 00:06:24,900
find actions to cover up the violation

94
00:06:24,900 --> 00:06:26,600
as established in the sixth circuit May

95
00:06:26,600 --> 00:06:27,600
2008.

96
00:06:29,000 --> 00:06:31,200
It's impressive, but you're sitting at a computer.

97
00:06:33,400 --> 00:06:34,500
playing hearts

98
00:06:36,500 --> 00:06:38,900
Sorry, if you want to beat me you're gonna have to do it as something

99
00:06:38,900 --> 00:06:40,700
else. How can you

100
00:06:40,700 --> 00:06:42,700
know all that? I told you I like to

101
00:06:42,700 --> 00:06:44,900
read and once I read something

102
00:06:44,900 --> 00:06:46,800
I understand it and once I understand

103
00:06:46,800 --> 00:06:47,200
it.

104
00:06:48,200 --> 00:06:50,800
I never forget it when I take the bar.

105
00:06:53,000 --> 00:06:55,700
This dickhead bet me I couldn't pass it without going to law school.

106
00:06:59,600 --> 00:07:01,700
Okay, look this is all

107
00:07:02,000 --> 00:07:04,500
pretty fascinating stuff, but I'm afraid I got to get back to work.

108
00:07:06,000 --> 00:07:08,900
I'll make sure the Serpico isn't around waiting for you.

109
00:07:24,100 --> 00:07:26,600
You want this job so much. Why don't you just go to law

110
00:07:26,600 --> 00:07:27,100
school?

111
00:07:28,900 --> 00:07:30,700
When I was in college, it was my dream to be a

112
00:07:30,700 --> 00:07:32,800
lawyer. I needed some money

113
00:07:33,500 --> 00:07:35,900
and Trevor convinced me to memorize

114
00:07:35,900 --> 00:07:37,700
this math test and sell

115
00:07:37,700 --> 00:07:38,100
it.

116
00:07:41,000 --> 00:07:43,700
Turns out we sold it to the Dean's daughter. I

117
00:07:43,700 --> 00:07:45,300
lost my scholarship. I got kicked out of

118
00:07:45,300 --> 00:07:46,200
school.

119
00:07:50,800 --> 00:07:52,500
I got knocked into a different life.

120
00:07:54,000 --> 00:07:56,300
And I have been wishing for a way back ever since.

121
00:08:01,100 --> 00:08:03,500
Let me tell you something. This is an

122
00:08:03,500 --> 00:08:05,500
elementary school. This is hard work

123
00:08:05,700 --> 00:08:07,700
long hours high pressure.

124
00:08:07,800 --> 00:08:09,600
I need a grown goddamn man.

125
00:08:11,000 --> 00:08:13,900
You give me this and I will work as hard as it takes

126
00:08:13,900 --> 00:08:15,700
to school those Harvard douches and become the

127
00:08:15,700 --> 00:08:17,500
best lawyer you have ever seen.

128
00:08:18,400 --> 00:08:20,900
I'm inclined to give you a shot. But what if I decided to go another

129
00:08:20,900 --> 00:08:22,400
way I say that's fair

130
00:08:23,600 --> 00:08:25,600
and sometimes I like to hang out with people who aren't that

131
00:08:25,600 --> 00:08:27,800
bright. It was just to see how the other half

132
00:08:27,800 --> 00:08:28,200
lives.

133
00:08:29,400 --> 00:08:31,800
Move over. I'm emailing The Firm. I

134
00:08:31,800 --> 00:08:33,300
just found our next associate.
